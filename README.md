# GNS3 Enterprise Network with Site-to-Site VPN

## 📜 Project Overview

This project, built entirely within GNS3, simulates a realistic network infrastructure for a small enterprise with a main Head Office and a remote Branch Office. The two offices are connected securely over a simulated public internet using a **Site-to-Site GRE over IPsec VPN tunnel**.

The primary objective is to demonstrate a comprehensive range of fundamental and advanced networking skills, from initial LAN design and segmentation to secure multi-site WAN connectivity.

## ✨ Key Skills Demonstrated

This single project showcases a comprehensive set of highly valuable, real-world networking skills:

* **Network Design:** Implementation of a **"Collapsed Core"** topology in the Head Office, a common and efficient model for small to medium-sized enterprise networks where core and distribution functions are combined into a single, powerful device.
* **VLANs:** Segmentation of the Head Office network into distinct departments (HR, IT, Marketing) for enhanced security and network organization.
* **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Configuration of a **"Router on a Stick" (ROAS)** on the edge router to enable controlled communication between different VLANs.
* **Layer 3 Switching (Simulation):** Use of a Cisco C3745 router with an `NM-16ESW` switching module to simulate the functionality of a Layer 3 Catalyst switch, a standard and necessary practice in GNS3.
* **Network Address Translation (PAT):** Configuration of Port Address Translation (NAT Overload) on the Head Office edge router to allow all internal users to access the internet using a single public IP address.
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Advanced use of extended ACLs to intelligently select traffic for NAT while specifically excluding private site-to-site traffic destined for the VPN.
* **Static Routing:** Implementation of static routes for WAN connectivity and to direct internal traffic through the secure VPN tunnel.
* **Site-to-Site VPN (GRE over IPsec):** Establishment of a secure, encrypted tunnel between the Head Office and Branch Office to protect all inter-office data traversing the simulated public internet.

## 🔢 IP Addressing Scheme

The IP addressing for this project utilizes distinct `/24` private networks for each department. **This was a deliberate design choice to provide significant room for future growth and scalability.** Allocating a full `/24` subnet to each segment ensures that a large number of additional hosts, servers, and devices can be added in the future without the need to re-design or re-address the network.

| Location          | Department / Link   | Network Address     | VLAN ID |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :------ |
| **Head Office**   | HR Department       | `192.168.10.0/24`   | 10      |
| **Head Office**   | IT Department       | `192.168.11.0/24`   | 11      |
| **Head Office**   | Marketing Dept      | `192.168.12.0/24`   | 12      |
| **Branch Office** | Branch LAN          | `192.168.20.0/24`   | N/A     |
| **WAN**           | HQ <--> ISP Link    | `10.0.0.0/30`       | N/A     |
| **WAN**           | ISP <--> Branch Link| `20.0.0.0/30`       | N/A     |
| **VPN Tunnel**    | Tunnel Link         | `172.16.1.0/30`     | N/A     |
